# Muhammad-Ali's Frontend Developer Portfolio

Hello there! I'm Muhammad-Ali. Welcome to the repository of my frontend developer portfolio, a project I undertook as part of the Hyperskill frontend course. Dive in to learn more about my journey, the challenges I faced, and the skills I acquired during this exciting endeavor!

## üéØ Project Objective

The main aim was to create a responsive and interactive portfolio that not only highlights my skills and projects but also provides a reflection of what I learned throughout the Hyperskill frontend course.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The backbone of the website, giving it structure and content.
- **CSS**: Used to beautify the website and ensure it's responsive to various device screens. All the styles are contained in `style.css`.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the dynamic features and interactivity of the site. The scripts included are:
  - `main.js`: Core functionalities of the site.
  - `menu-button.js`: Handles the animation and interactivity of the menu button.
  - `modal-button.js`: Manages the modals that appear when you click on a project in the Portfolio section.
